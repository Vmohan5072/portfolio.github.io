                    <h3>Gaming</h3>
                    <p>Gaming is my biggest passion in life, as my lifelong experience with them has greatly shaped my career aspirations. Riot Games, Rockstar Games, and Valve have been the biggest influences that have shaped my childhood and remain a cornerstone of my hobby life. Most of my gaming has been dedicated towards online multiplayer experiences, but I always love trying several singleplayer and local multiplayer games across older and current consoles.</p>

                    <h3>Cars</h3>
                    <p>Cars have been a lifelong hobby, ever since I have obsessively watched Top Gear as a kid. Ever since I was 18, I dedicate many hours towards mastering several aspects of being a car enthusiast, particularly with BMW's. I learned how to do both basic maintenance and large repair work for my cars, participate in local track driving and autocross events, and been an active participant in automotive forums, subreddits, and Discord servers.</p>
