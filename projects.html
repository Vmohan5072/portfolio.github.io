                    <h3>MythBot: A Discord Bot for League of Legends</h3>
                    <p>Developed in JavaScript with the Discord.js framework, MythBot communicates with the Riot Games API to provide League of Legends account information and management to Discord servers. The bot can retrieve and display player account information, such as ranks, top champion mastery, and account levels. The bot includes several features such as the ability to display a server leaderboard for ranks and champion masteries, as well as the ability to create queues for custom League of Legends lobbies, that balances teams based on rank and account levels. The accounts are saved and retrieved from a Postgres database, and hosted on Railway. MythBot is a constantly evolving project, with new functions from more APIs to come!</p>

                    <h3>Naive Bayes Spam Filter</h3>
                    <p>A Python-based web application hosted on Heroku, the Naive Bayes Spam Filter imports one or several text files, processes the text by sanitizing, normalizing, and stemming it, and uses the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm to determine the probability that the email text file is spam. The Naive Bayes classifier is trained with thousands of pre-processed training files provided by the Enron Spam Dataset.</p>
